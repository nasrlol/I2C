# I2C

A application to control an I2C display on RPI.
This application should represent a multi-use software with features ranging from a bus line analyser, bus delay analiser, an generative AI command line, weather reports, note's saving and much more.

This is a starter project with the goal of expanded everything later on to let's say an e-ink display or small LCD.

18/11/2024 migrating to C for the main code

The program is Multi-platform and even supports a web-console

MAIN USE OF THE PROGRAM : 

the main feature of the program is the ability to control and I2C display really extensivly and be abel to do alot of things with it

CURRENT FEATURES -> 

* weather display
* random generated greeting quote ( still dont know what to really do about that, could add a joke of the day system or something like that)
* a button powered button pomodore timer 
* some sort of clock mechanisme that adds an alarm clock, timer and stopwatch
* system monitor dashbord ( cpu , ram , disk , temp , ... ) 
* speech command center
* generative AI model that uses meta's llama 
* current playing audio
* voice based notes
* to do list integration based on the personal calender


A nice idea is to make it somehting easily installabled and configurable in the future without to much tinkering need
