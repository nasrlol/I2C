The software supports multiple fetures ranging from a note saving system ( which is actually a fun way of saying displaying something on the screen and saving the output for later use) to speech transription and system readings.

The main way of using the software is the CLI. run the main.py file and you will see the options pop, after running them they will run automaticly, the CLI is still the recomended way of using it simply because it's ment for controlling an RPI through an SSH session.
